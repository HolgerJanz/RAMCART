and SpartaDOS 3

RAMCART Dn: [/DF]

RAMCART is a ramdisk driver for
THE!CART. Dx: specifies the drive
number n that should be used for the
ramdisk. The drive n-1 is used for
the Flash Disk. RAMCARTS (store)
and RAMCARTR (restore) can be used
to copy between this tow disks.
With option /D only the
ramdisk driver will be installed.
With option /F the ramdisk
will be formatted with 4096 sectors
of 128 Bytes and SpartaDOS file
system.
Without options the ramdisk driver
is installed and formatted
on demand.

XINIT can be used to format with
a different size. The original
ramdisk driver of SpartaDOS can be
simultaneously used with the
RAMCART driver.

RAMCART is optimized using 128 Bytes
Sectors and works only in VBLANK with
display synchronization. XINIT can
only be used with 128 Bytes sectors
formats (single density).

RETURN or ESC in the start menu of
