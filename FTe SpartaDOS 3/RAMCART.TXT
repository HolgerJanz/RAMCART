Dx: specifies the drive
number n that should be used for the
ram disk. The drive n-1 is used for
the Flash Disk. RAMCARTS (store)
and RAMCARTR (restore) can be used
to copy between this tow disks.
With option /D only the
ram disk driver will be installed.
With option /F the ram disk
will be formatted with 4096 sectors
of 128 Bytes and SpartaDOS file
system.
Without options the ram disk driver
is installed and formatted
on demand.

Da:to Dd: specifies the drive number
for the flash disks. Use RAMCARTS to
copy the ram disk to the flash
disk (store). Use RAMCARTR to
copy the flash disk to the ram
disk (restore).

XINIT can be used to format with
a different size. The original
ramdisk driver of SpartaDOS can be
simultaneously used with the
RAMCART driver.

RAMCART is optimized using 128 Bytes
Sectors and works only in VBLANK with
display synchronization. XINIT can
only be used with 128 Bytes sectors
formats (single density).

SECOPY is a special sector copy
program for any disk of single
density. It is useful to copy
whole disk to and from ram or
flash disk.

TCAR is a program to switch between
different The Cart entries without
cold start and reboot. The file
TC.CFG is use to specify the names
and banks of an entry.

SETOSSIO resets the SparatDOS SIO
vector to the OS routine.
PS: Do not forget to use SHIFT with
RETURN or ESC in the start menu of
THE!CART to enable the access to the
configuration.
