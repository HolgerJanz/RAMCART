RAMCART - Ramdisk Driver for THE!CART
and SpartaDOS 3

RAMCART Dx: [/N]
RAMCARTF Dx: [/N]

RAMCART[F] is a ramdisk driver for
THE!CART. Dx: specifies the drive
number x that should be used for the
ramdisk. With option /N the ramdisk
will not be formatted. Without the
option /N the ramdisk will be
formatted with 4096 sectors of 128
Bytes and SpartaDOS file system.
XINIT can be used to format with
a different size. The original
ramdisk driver of SpartaDOS can be
simultaneously used with the
RAMCART driver.

RAMCART is optimized using 128 Bytes
Sectors and works only in VBLANK with
display synchronization. XINIT can
only be used with 128 Bytes sectors
formats (single density).

RAMCARTF is a more flexible version.
It can also handle 256 Bytes sectors
(double density).
XINIT can be used with all formats.
Furthermore this version is more than
three times faster. The downside is 
that the display is flickering
during access to the ramdisk because
there is no synchronization with the
display.

RAMCART and RAMCARTF can be
simultaneously used to access the
same ramdisk with different drive
numbers. This only works with
128 Bytes formats.

PS: Do not forget to use SHIFT with
RETURN or ESC in the start menu of
THE!CART to enable the access to the
configuration.
