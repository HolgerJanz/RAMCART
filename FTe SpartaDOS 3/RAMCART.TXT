RAMCART - Ramdisk Driver for THE!CART
and SpartaDOS 3

RAMCART Dx: [/N|A|F]

RAMCART is a ramdisk driver for
THE!CART. Dx: specifies the drive
number x that should be used for the
ramdisk. With option /N the ramdisk
will not be formatted. Without the
option /N the ramdisk will be
formatted with 4096 sectors of 128
Bytes and SpartaDOS file system.
Option /A formats only if needed
and option /F only formats without
installing driver.
XINIT can be used to format with
a different size. The original
ramdisk driver of SpartaDOS can be
simultaneously used with the
RAMCART driver.

RAMCART is optimized using 128 Bytes
Sectors and works only in VBLANK with
display synchronization. XINIT can
only be used with 128 Bytes sectors
formats (single density).

PS: Do not forget to use SHIFT with
RETURN or ESC in the start menu of
THE!CART to enable the access to the
configuration.
