RAMDISKU - Ramdisk Driver for
SpartaDOS 3

RAMCARTU Dx: [/NE]

RAMCARTU is a ramdisk driver for
SpartaDOS and RAMBO compatible RAM
extensions from 64k to 1024k. It is
derived form the original
RD Ver 2.3 07-14-86 by FTe delivered
originally with SpartaDOS 3.2. The
main difference is that RAMBO 1024k
extensions and Ultimate1MB are
supported in addition.

Dx: specifies the drive
number x that should be used for the
ramdisk. With option /N the ramdisk
will not be formatted. Without the
option /N the ramdisk will be
formatted. The option /E spares the
first 4 banks to be compatible with
130XE and programs that uses the 
extended memory.

RAMDISKU can be simultaneously used 
with RAMCART and/or RAMCARTF.
